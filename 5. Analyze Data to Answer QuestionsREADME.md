# Course â€“ 5: Analyze Data to Answer Questions

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this course, you will be able to:
- Discuss the importance of organizing your data before analysis by using sorts and filters.
- Convert and format data.
- Apply the use of functions and syntax to create SQL queries to combine data from multiple database tables.
- Describe the use of functions to conduct basic calculations on data in spreadsheets.

## Analyze Data

### 1. **Data Analysis**
- **Analysis**: The process of making sense of the data collected.
- **Phases of Data Analysis**:
  1. Organize Data
  2. Format & Adjust Data
  3. Get input from others
  4. Transform Data

---

### 2. **Outliers**
Outliers are data points that significantly differ from the rest of the data. These may not be reliable values and can skew the results of an analysis.

---

## Sorting and Filtering Data

### 1. **Sorting**
Sorting involves arranging data into a meaningful order to make it easier to understand, analyze, and visualize.
- **Examples**: Sorting data from **new to old**, or from **highest to lowest**.

### 2. **Filtering**
Filtering displays only the data that meets a specific criterion and hides the rest. It is useful for focusing on relevant information.

### 3. **Sort Sheet vs. Sort Range**
- **Sort Sheet**: Sorts all the data in a spreadsheet based on a specific column. The data across rows is kept together.
- **Sort Range**: Only sorts the specified cells in a column, without rearranging the rest of the data in the sheet.

### 4. **Customized Sort Order**
A customized sort order involves sorting data using multiple conditions, providing more flexibility in organizing the data.

## SQL Query Concepts

### 1. **Sorting in SQL**
- **ORDER BY**: Used to sort data in SQL. The default order is ascending.

### 2. **Data Validation in Excel**
- Ensures the data entered into a worksheet meets specific criteria.
  - Create **dropdown lists** with predetermined options.
  - Use **check boxes** to limit entries.
  - Protect structured data and formulas.

### 3. **SQL Functions**
- **CONCAT_WS**: Concatenate values with a separator.
- **CONCAT**: Concatenates multiple text strings into one.

---

## Data Aggregation and Advanced SQL

### 1. **Data Aggregation**
- **Aggregation**: The process of gathering data from various sources and combining it into a single summarized collection.
  - **Purpose**: Identify trends, make comparisons, and explain insights.

### 2. **Subquery**
- A **Subquery** is a query within a query, used to extract data from a nested set of criteria.

---

## SQL Joins

### 1. **JOIN Clauses**
- **INNER JOIN**: Returns records that have matching values in both tables.
- **LEFT JOIN**: Returns all records from the left table and matching records from the right table.
- **RIGHT JOIN**: Returns all records from the right table and matching records from the left table.
- **FULL OUTER JOIN**: Returns all matching records from both tables.

### 2. **Aggregation Functions in SQL**
- **COUNT**: Counts the number of values in a specified range.
- **COUNT DISTINCT**: Returns only the distinct values within a specified range.
- **SUMIF**: Adds numeric data based on a condition.
  - Syntax: `=SUMIF(range, criteria, [sum-range])`
- **SUMPRODUCT**: Multiplies arrays and returns the sum of those products.
  - Syntax: `=SUMPRODUCT(array1, [array2]...)`

---

## Advanced Excel Functions

### 1. **Calculated Field in Pivot Table**
- A **Calculated Field** is a new field within a pivot table that carries out calculations based on the values of other fields.

### 2. **Modulo Operator**
- The **Modulo** operator (`%`) returns the remainder when one number is divided by another.

### 3. **GROUP BY Clause in SQL**
- The **GROUP BY** command groups rows with the same values into summary rows.

### 4. **EXTRACT Function**
- The **EXTRACT** function allows us to pull specific parts of data from a dataset for use in further analysis.

---

## Data Validation Process

### 1. **Data Validation Types**
- **Data Type**: Checking that the data type matches the expected type.
- **Data Range**: Ensures data falls within the defined range.
- **Data Constraints**: Ensures that data makes sense within its context.
- **Data Structure**: Ensures the data conforms to a set structure.
- **Code Validation**: Ensures that the data validation process is applied during the execution of application code.

---

## Temporary Tables in SQL

### 1. **Temporary Tables**
- A **Temporary Table** is a database table created for temporary use within a session.
- **WITH** clause allows querying multiple times from a temporary table.

### 2. **Creating Temporary Tables**
- **WITH clause**, **SELECT INTO**, **CREATE TABLE**, and **CREATE TEMP TABLE** statements are used to create temporary tables.

## Conclusion
By organizing and validating data before performing analysis, and utilizing SQL functions and Excel tools, you will be able to answer data-driven questions and gain valuable insights from your datasets.
