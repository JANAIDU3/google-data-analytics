## Core Concepts in R

### 1. **Functions in R**
- Functions allow you to perform specific actions and return results.
- Example: `mean()`, `sum()`, `lm()` (for linear models).

### 2. **Variables and Data Types**
- **Variables**: Used to store data in R.
  - Example: `x <- 10` assigns the value 10 to the variable `x`.
- **Data Types**: Different kinds of data you can store in variables:
  - Numeric
  - Character
  - Logical (TRUE/FALSE)
  - Factor
  - Date

### 3. **Vectors**
- A vector is a basic data structure in R, which holds multiple elements of the same data type.
  - Example: `c(1, 2, 3, 4)` creates a vector of numbers.

### 4. **Pipes in R**
- **Pipes (`%>%`)**: Allow you to pass the output of one function directly into another function.
  - Example: `data %>% filter(condition) %>% summarize(mean(value))`

## Visualizations in R

### 1. **Generating Visualizations**
- R provides a variety of tools for data visualization, including:
  - **Base R Plotting**: Basic plot functions like `plot()`, `hist()`, and `boxplot()`.
  - **ggplot2**: A popular package for advanced visualizations.
    - Example: `ggplot(data, aes(x = variable1, y = variable2)) + geom_point()`

## R Markdown

### 1. **What is R Markdown?**
- **R Markdown**: A formatting tool in R that allows you to create dynamic documents that combine R code, output, and text in a single file.

### 2. **Formatting in R Markdown**
- You can structure your document using different elements:
  - **Headers**: `#`, `##`, `###` for various levels of headings.
  - **Code Chunks**: Use triple backticks to embed R code and run it directly within the document.
  - **Text Formatting**: Use Markdown syntax for bold, italics, and lists.

---

## Conclusion
R programming is a powerful language for statistical analysis and data visualization, and with R Markdown, you can seamlessly combine your analysis and results into a presentable format. Understanding these basic concepts will help you harness the full potential of R for data-driven insights.
# R Programming – Data Structures and File Handling

## Key Concepts

### 1. **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**
- **IDE**: A software application that integrates multiple tools to aid in programming. It provides a convenient interface for writing, testing, and debugging code.

### 2. **Pipes in R**
- **Pipes** (`%>%`): A powerful tool in R used to chain multiple operations together, making the code easier to read and maintain. It passes the output of one operation directly to the next.

---

## Basic Concepts in R

### 1. **Functions**
- **Functions**: A reusable block of code in R that performs a specific task. Functions can take **arguments** as inputs and return outputs.
  - Example: `sum(x)` is a function that calculates the sum of all elements in `x`.

### 2. **Arguments**
- **Arguments**: The inputs required by functions in R to perform their tasks. These inputs can be variables, data structures, or even constants.

### 3. **Variables (Objects)**
- **Variables (Objects)**: A container that stores a value in R. These values can be used later in calculations or analysis.
  - Example: `x <- 10` assigns the value `10` to the variable `x`.

### 4. **Vectors**
- **Vectors**: A fundamental data structure in R. A vector stores elements of the same type (e.g., all numeric, all character).
  - Example: `c(1, 2, 3)` creates a numeric vector.

### 5. **Pipes**
- **Pipes** (`%>%`): A tool used to pass the result of one operation as the input to the next, making your code cleaner and more readable.
  - Example: `data %>% filter(condition) %>% select(columns)` applies a filter to the data and then selects specific columns.

## Data Structures in R

### 1. **Vectors**
- **Vectors** are the simplest data structure in R. They hold elements of the same data type.
  - **Creation**: `c(1, 2, 3)` creates a numeric vector.
  - **Types of Atomic Vectors**:
    - **Logical**: `TRUE/FALSE`
    - **Integer**: `1L, 2L, 3L` (with `L` indicating integer type)
    - **Double**: `1.5, 3.14`
    - **Character**: `"Coding"`

### 2. **Matrices**
- **Matrices**: Two-dimensional arrays that hold elements of the same type. Can be created with the `matrix()` function.
  - Example: `matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4), nrow = 2, ncol = 2)` creates a 2x2 matrix.

### 3. **Data Frames**
- **Data Frames**: Two-dimensional structures where each column can have different data types, often used for tabular data.
  - Example: `data.frame(x = c(1, 2, 3), y = c(1.5, 5.5, 7.5))` creates a data frame with two columns (`x` and `y`).

### 4. **Lists**
- **Lists**: Can store elements of different data types (vectors, matrices, data frames, etc.). Lists are more flexible than vectors.
  - Example: `list(a = 1, b = "text", c = TRUE)` creates a list with different data types.

### 5. **Atomic Vectors**
- **Atomic Vectors**: The basic building blocks of R vectors. Each type of atomic vector (logical, integer, double, character) stores specific kinds of data.

---

## Working with Data

### 1. **Creating Vectors**
- **Numeric Vector**: `c(1, 2, 3)`
- **Integer Vector**: `c(1L, 2L, 3L)` (Note: `L` denotes integers)

### 2. **Determining the Structure of a List**
- Use `str()` to check the structure of any object.
  - Example: `str(list1)` will display the structure of the `list1` object.

### 3. **Finding Current Date & Time**
- **Sys.Date()**: Returns the current system date.
- **Sys.time()**: Returns the current system date and time.

### 4. **Creating Data Frames**
- **Data Frame Creation**: Use the `data.frame()` function to create a data frame.
  - Example: `data.frame(x = c(1, 2, 3), y = c(1.5, 5.5, 7.5))`

---

## File Handling in R

### 1. **Creating a New Folder**
- **`dir.create()`**: Creates a new folder in the current directory.
  - Example: `dir.create("new_folder")`

### 2. **Creating a Blank File**
- **`file.create()`**: Creates a blank file in the specified directory.
  - Example: `file.create("new_file.txt")`

### 3. **Copying a File**
- **`file.copy()`**: Copies a file from one location to another.
  - Example: `file.copy("old_file.txt", "new_file.txt")`

### 4. **Deleting a File**
- **`unlink()`**: Deletes a file from the directory.
  - Example: `unlink("file_to_delete.txt")`

## Conclusion

In this section, we've covered essential R programming concepts such as functions, vectors, and data structures, alongside file handling operations. R’s flexibility and powerful data handling capabilities make it a great tool for statistical analysis, data visualization, and file management.
# Operators, Packages, and Data Structures in R Programming

## Operators in R

### Types of Operators:
1. **Arithmetic Operators**: Used for mathematical calculations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
2. **Relational Operators**: Used to compare values and determine relationships (e.g., `==`, `>`, `<`, `>=`).
3. **Logical Operators**: Used to perform logical operations between values.

### Logical Operators:
- **AND (`&`, `&&`)**: Returns TRUE only if both values are TRUE.
- **OR (`|`, `||`)**: Returns TRUE if either one of the values is TRUE.
- **NOT (`!`)**: Negates the logical value it applies to (e.g., TRUE becomes FALSE and vice versa).

### Example:
```r
# Logical operations
x <- TRUE
y <- FALSE
x & y  # Returns FALSE
x | y  # Returns TRUE
!x     # Returns FALSE
