## Problems Faced by Data Analysts

Data analysts encounter a variety of problems that require them to use data to make informed decisions. Here are some common challenges:

1. **Making Predictions** (e.g., Best advertising method)
2. **Categorizing Things** (Organizing data into specific groups)
3. **Spotting Something Unusual** (Identifying outliers or anomalies)
4. **Identifying Themes** (Grouping categorized information into broader concepts)
5. **Discovering Connections** (Finding similar challenges or patterns across data)
6. **Finding Patterns** (Using historical data to identify trends)

---

## SMART Criteria for Problem Solving

In order to effectively tackle problems, data analysts follow the SMART framework:

- **S**pecific
- **M**easurable
- **A**ctionable
- **R**elevant
- **T**ime-bound

This criteria helps make sure the problem is clearly defined and achievable.

## Types of Questions

Data analysts need to ask the right types of questions to guide their analysis. These include:

- **Heading**: Questions that steer people toward a particular response.
- **Closed-ended**: Questions with yes/no answers.
- **Vague**: Questions with no content or clear direction.

---

## Data-Informed Decision Making

**Data-informed decision-making** explores different data sources to find out what they have in common. The goal is to base decisions on actual data rather than intuition alone.

---

## Algorithms in Data Analysis

An **Algorithm** is a set of rules or processes to follow in order to complete a specific task. Algorithms are fundamental to automating decision-making processes.

---

## Types of Data

### Quantitative Data
- **Quantitative Data** includes measurable facts, numbers, and logic.
  - These are specific and objective measures of numerical facts.

### Qualitative Data
- **Qualitative Data** deals with "why" questions and offers subjective or explanatory measures of qualities or characteristics.

---

## Reports vs Dashboards

### Reports
- A report is a static collection of data presented periodically to stakeholders.

  **Pros:**
  - Easy to design.
  - Pre-designed and sorted data.
  - High-level historical data.

  **Cons:**
  - Requires continual maintenance.
  - Can be less appealing visually.
  - Static (doesn't update in real-time).

### Dashboards
- A dashboard is a dynamic tool that monitors live, incoming data.

  **Pros:**
  - Dynamic, automatic, and interactive.
  - More accessible to stakeholders.
  - Requires low maintenance.

  **Cons:**
  - Labor-intensive design process.
  - Can be confusing.
  - Data may be unclean or incomplete.
# Course Notes: Pivot Tables, Metrics, Errors, and More

## Pivot Tables

A **Pivot Table** is a data summarization tool used in data processing. It allows you to summarize, sort, recognize, group, count, or average data stored in a database.

- **Transform**: Rows → Columns (pivoting data to see it in different perspectives)

---

## Metrics

- A **Metric** is a quantifiable type of data that can be used for measurement.
- **Metric Goal**: A measurable goal set by a company and evaluated using metrics.

---

## Revenue and ROI

### Revenue
- **Revenue** is defined as the number of sales multiplied by the sales price.

### ROI (Return on Investment)
- **ROI** is calculated as the net profit over a period of time divided by the cost of investment.
- It’s a metric used to assess the profitability of an investment.

---

## Dashboards

Dashboards are used to monitor and analyze data. There are different types of dashboards:

- **Strategic Dashboard**: Focuses on high-level business metrics.
- **Operational Dashboard**: Tracks day-to-day business operations.
- **Analytical Dashboard**: Provides in-depth insights into data trends and patterns.

---

## Spreadsheet Tasks

### Cell Reference
- A **Cell Reference** refers to a single cell or a group of cells in a worksheet that can be used in a formula.

### Organizing Data
- You can use **Pivot Tables** to organize data by sorting, filtering, and summarizing information in meaningful ways.

### Calculating Data
- Formulas and **functions** are used to perform calculations in spreadsheets.

---

## Common Spreadsheet Errors

### Errors You Might Encounter:

- `#DIV/0!`: Occurs when dividing by zero.
- `#EEEE!`: (Only in Google Sheets) Occurs when a formula can't be interpreted.
- `#N/A`: Means the data is not found in the spreadsheet.
- `#NAME?`: Formula or function name isn’t understood.
- `#NUM!`: Formula or function calculation can’t be performed as specified.
- `#VALUE!`: General error, indicating a problem with the formula or referenced cells.
- `#REF!`: Formula is referencing a cell that no longer exists or has been deleted.

---

## Functions vs. Formulas

- **Function**: A preset command that automatically performs a specific process or task using the data.
- **Formula**: A set of instructions given to perform calculations.

---

## Problem Domain and Scope

### Problem Domain
- A **Problem Domain** refers to the specific area of analysis that encompasses every activity affecting or affected by the problem.

### Scope & Work (SOW)
- **Scope of Work (SOW)**: An agreed-upon framework outlining the work you’re going to perform on a project.

### Statement of Work (SOW)
- A **Statement of Work (SOW)** is a document that identifies the products and services a vendor or contractor will provide to an organization. It includes:
  - **Objectives**
  - **Guidelines**
  - **Deliverables**
  - **Schedule**
  - **Cost**
