## Data Visualization

### 1. **What is Data Visualization?**
- **Data Visualization**: The graphic representation and presentation of data.
  1. Looking at visuals to understand and draw conclusions about data.
  2. Creating visuals using raw data to tell a story.

### 2. **Marks and Channels**
- **Marks**: Visual objects like points, lines, shapes, etc.
- **Channels**: Visual aspects that represent characteristics of data.
  - **Position**
  - **Size**
  - **Shape**
  - **Color**
  - **Grouping**

---

### 3. **Common Data Visualizations**
- **Bar Graphs**: Use size contrast to compare two or more values.
- **Line Graphs**: Help your audience understand shifts or changes in data.
- **Pie Charts**: Show how much each part makes up the whole.
- **Maps**: Organize data geographically.
- **Histograms**: Show how often data values fall into specific ranges.
- **Correlation Charts**: Show relationships among data.

---

### 4. **Causation vs. Correlation**
- **Causation**: Occurs when an action directly leads to an outcome.
- **Correlation**: Indicates a relationship between two variables but not necessarily causality.

---

### 5. **Types of Visualization**
- **Static Visualizations**: Do not change over time unless edited.
- **Dynamic Visualizations**: Interactive and change over time.

### 6. **Tableau**
- **Tableau**: A business intelligence and analytics platform used to see, understand, and make decisions with data.

---

## Decision Tree

### 1. **Examples of Visuals**
- **One Numeric Variable**: Histogram, Density Plot
- **Multiple Datasets**: Line Chart, Pie Chart, Bar Chart, Area, Stacked Bar
- **Change Over Time**: Live Chart, Scatter Plot
- **Correlation**: Heatmap

### 2. **Elements of Art**
1. Line
2. Shape
3. Color
4. Space
5. Movement

## Principles for Effective Data Visualization

### 1. **Effective Data Visualization Elements**
- Clear meaning
- Sophisticated use of contrast
- Refined execution

### 2. **Design Thinking Process**
- **Empathize**: Understand emotions
- **Define**: Define needs
- **Ideate**: Generate ideas
- **Prototype**: Create charts and visualizations
- **Test**: Test visualizations

---

### 3. **Key Visualization Components**
- **Headline**: A large title at the top of a visualization to communicate the main data message.
- **Subtitle**: Provides additional context and description for the visualization.
- **Legend**: Explains the meaning of various elements in the data visualization.
- **Labeling**: Key component of making data visualizations accessible.
- **Alternative Text**: Provides a textual alternative to non-text content for accessibility.

## Tools and Techniques

### 1. **Data Types in Visualization**
- **#**: Numeric data
- **Abc**: Alphanumeric data
- **Globe**: Geographic data
- **Calendar with Clock**: Date & Time data

### 2. **Color Palette**
- **Diverging Color Palette**: Displays two ranges of values using color intensity, showing the magnitude and range of numbers.

### 3. **Visualization Tools**
- **Pan Tool**: Selecting a region (e.g., European region).
- **Shape Tool**: Selecting areas with the same characteristics (e.g., countries in Europe).
- **Lasso Tool**: Selecting specific items (e.g., few countries).

### 4. **Dashboard**
- **Dashboard**: A tool that organizes information from multiple datasets into one central location for tracking, analysis, and simple visualization.
- **Dashboard Filter**: Filters data based on specific criteria, showing only relevant information.

## Data Storytelling

### 1. **What is Data Storytelling?**
- **Data Storytelling**: Communicating meaning from a dataset using visuals and a narrative tailored to the audience.

### 2. **Steps for Data Storytelling**
1. **Engage Your Audience**: Capture attention and generate interest.
2. **Create Compelling Visuals**: Use visuals to make the story come alive.
3. **Tell the Story in an Interesting Variation**: Use different methods to convey the message effectively.

---

### 3. **Effective Data Visualization**
- **Spotlighting**: Quickly scanning data to highlight important insights.
- **Cohesiveness**: Ensuring your data visualization is balanced and makes good use of space.

---

### 4. **Presentation Best Practices**

#### **Bad Presentation Traits**
1. No story or logical flow.
2. No title or context.
3. Excessive text.
4. Hard to understand.
5. Inconsistent format, no theme.
6. Missing conclusion or recommendations.

#### **Good Presentation Tips**

2. Start with broad ideas and narrow down.
3. Use the five-second rule: Ensure the main point is clear in 5 seconds.
4. Preparation is key.

### 5. **Q&A Best Practices**
- Listen well and understand the context.
- Involve the audience and keep responses brief.
- Repeat the question if necessary and keep answers audience-friendly.
