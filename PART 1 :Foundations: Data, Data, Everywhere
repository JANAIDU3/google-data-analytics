# Google Data Analysis Course Notes

## Course 1: Foundation - Data, Data, Everywhere

### Key Concepts

- **Data Analysis** is the collection, transformation, and organization of data to draw conclusions, make predictions, and drive informed decision-making.
- **Data Analytics** → Science of data.
- **Cloud**: Place to keep data online rather than on a computer hard drive.
- **Data-driven Decision Making**: Using facts to guide business strategy.
- **Role of Data Analyst**: Finds data, analyzes it, and uses it to uncover trends, patterns, and relationships.

### Data Analysis Life Cycle

The data analysis process is a series of steps to transform raw data into actionable insights. These steps include:

1. **Discovery**
2. **Pre-processing data**
3. **Model Planning**
4. **Model Building**
5. **Communicate Results**
6. **Operationalize**

### Context:
Condition in which something exists or happens. Understanding context is vital to effectively analyzing and interpreting data.

## People Analytics

People Analytics (HR Analytics or Workforce Analytics) is the practice of collecting and analyzing data on the people that make up a company's workforce. This helps gain insights to improve how a company operates.

- **Objectives**:
  1. Employee potential
  2. Motivate people
  3. Ensure fair and inclusive company culture
## Six Steps of Data Analysis

The following are the six essential steps involved in data analysis:

1. **Ask**: Define the problem or question.
2. **Prepare**: Collect relevant data.
3. **Process**: Clean the data to make it suitable for analysis.
4. **Analyze**: Apply statistical methods and algorithms to extract insights.
5. **Share**: Communicate findings with stakeholders.
6. **Act**: Use the insights to guide decision-making.

## Data Science and Analytics

**Data Science** encompasses various techniques, including Machine Learning (ML) and statistics, to analyze data. The goal is to develop new ways of modeling and understanding data to gain insights and solve problems.

- **Data Science** → ML (Machine Learning)
- **ML** → Many decisions under uncertainty.
- **Statistics** → Managing uncertainty.
- **Analytics** → Drawing insights from data.

## Project-Based Data Analytics Life Cycle

1. **Identifying the Problem**
2. **Designing Data Requirements**
3. **Pre-processing Data**
4. **Performing Data Analysis**
5. **Visualizing Data**

## Data Life Cycle

The data life cycle includes all the stages from the planning and collection of data to its storage, analysis, and eventual destruction:

1. **Plan**: Define the goals and objectives of the data analysis.
2. **Capture**: Gather the necessary data.
3. **Manage**: Organize and store the data.
4. **Analyze**: Process and analyze the data.
5. **Archive**: Save or backup data for future use.
6. **Destroy**: Safely dispose of data that is no longer needed.
## Data Analysis Tools

There are several tools that data analysts use to manage, analyze, and visualize data:

1. **Spreadsheets**: For storing and organizing data.
2. **Databases**: Systems designed to store large volumes of data.
3. **Query Languages**: For querying and manipulating data within databases.
4. **Visualization Software**: Tools like Tableau or Power BI for creating visual representations of data.

## Key Terms

### Formula
A set of instructions that perform a specific calculation using data in a spreadsheet.

### Function
A preset command that automatically performs a task or process using data.

### Query Language
A programming language used to retrieve and manipulate data from a database. Common examples include SQL.

---

## Spreadsheets and Query Languages

### Spreadsheets
- **Collect**, **store**, **organize**, and **sort** data.
- **Identify patterns** and **visualize** trends through charts and graphs.

### Query Languages
- **Isolate information** by writing specific queries.
- **Understand requests** to retrieve the needed data.
- **Select and curate data** efficiently.

---

## SQL (Structured Query Language)

SQL is commonly used for querying databases. It involves the following:

1. **SELECT**: To choose columns of data.
2. **FROM**: To choose the tables where the data is located.
3. **WHERE**: To filter data based on certain criteria.

#### Additional SQL Concepts

- **Semicolon**: A statement terminator in SQL queries.
- **Observation**: Attributes that describe a piece of data contained in a row of a table.
- **% or * (Asterisk)**: Used for pattern matching.
  - Example: `Ah*` → Ahmed / Ahmad
- **Aliases**: Providing an alternate name for a column or table using `AS`.
- **<>**: Used to denote "does not equal" in SQL.
## Data Visualization Steps

To effectively communicate insights, it's essential to visualize data. Here are the steps:

1. **Explore**: Investigate the data for patterns and trends.
2. **Plan**: Determine the type of visualization that best represents the data.
3. **Create**: Develop the visualization (e.g., charts, graphs, tables).

## Key Business Analysis Concepts

- **Issue**: The topic or subject under investigation.
- **Question**: The inquiry designed to discover insights from the data.
- **Problem**: An obstacle or complication that needs to be solved using data analysis.
- **Business Task**: A problem or question related to business decision-making.

## Structured Thinking

Structured thinking is the process of recognizing a problem, organizing information, evaluating opportunities, and identifying options.

It includes:
- Breaking down complex problems into manageable pieces.
- Using logic and reasoning to evaluate data and possible solutions.
